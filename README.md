# Binomial-Equations
Tasks that this code can perform:
- Find and print any variable in any row of Pascal's Triangle
- Find and print any row of Pascal's Triangle
- Print a range of rows of Pascal's Tirangle
- Solve any Binomial Equation

Note - I have just finished the binomial equation code, so it may have some visual roughness, but the maths should work for any logical equation
