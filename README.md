# Binomial-Equations
Tasks that this code can perform:
- Find and print any variable in any row of Pascal's Triangle
- Find and print any row of Pascal's Triangle
- Print a range of rows of Pascal's Tirangle
- Solve any Binomial Equation

Note - if your Binomial equations conatins powers of an unkown variable, please write down the variable multiple times, for example x to the power of five should be written as 'xxxxx'

I am currently experimenting with other nomial equations, like trinomial and quadranomial. I have managed to find a pattern for both and may add them to the code in the future. I am also working on finding patterns to the following nomials and hopefully I will eventually find a pattern for the patterns.
